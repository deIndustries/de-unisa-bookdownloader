Thanks for making me have to write this....

How to use.
1. First Run: de-unisa-bookdownloader-1-book-page-dl.py. This will use your mouse and keyboard to scroll through the book and save each page.
2. Then after that process is complete run de-unisa-bookdownloader-2-jpgs-to-pdf.py as this will convert all the JPG's into PDFS.
3. Use other tools to merge all the PDFs into a single page.
4. Enjoy the PDF!
